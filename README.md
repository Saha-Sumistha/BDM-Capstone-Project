# Capstone Project : Data Analysis of a Wholesale Greengrocer shop
## Business description :
This data analysis report is based on wholesale
greengrocer shop which is owned by my grandfather
Sri Narayan Chandra Saha.
The wholesale items are potato,ginger,onion and
garlic. His business has been running for about 40 years.
## Data collection :
When i came to know about this Capstone
Project i asked my grandfather to give me his daily
business data about more than one month.
So he gave me his daily business data from
01.09.21-15.10.21 . But the data was unstructured. So I started
cleaning those data. I Tried my best to structure it in a proper way. First I put all that data in my
excel sheet and then started analysing it .
## My Analysis:
* Total profit in 45 days. Average profit per kg from each item.
* Day wise sells for each item.
* Day wise volume(in kg) trend and day wise revenue trend .
* Daily volume trend and daily revenue trend to know the outliers.
* Daily revenue growth to understand the lowest growth day.
* Revenue Pareto chart and Volume Pareto chart on sale.
* ScatterPlot to analyse total volume vs total revenue.
## Some basic recommendations:
* The overall performance of this business is good. So here I added some basic recommendations.
* To give a look on garlic sales as it has the highest profit per kg .
* Try to keep the shop open as many hours as possible on Wednesday because
more revenue has come from that day.
* Try to add online payment methods . Because nowadays customers prefer online
payment rather than giving cash.
